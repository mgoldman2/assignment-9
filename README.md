# assignment-9
I used the Dionaea honeypot.
The only issues i encountered were towards the end, collecting the data on the Virtual Machine side. Meaning, I was able to use gCloud and found my honeypot & attack, but my JSon file was completely empty after re-running the commands multiple times. I am including a .gif file to illustrate that I have the attack down. 
My attack report was the attack from Poland, I had only one attack.
